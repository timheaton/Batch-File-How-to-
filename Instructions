How to Create a Batch File to Run a Python Script
June 26, 2021
In this guide, you’ll see the complete steps to create a batch file to run a Python script.

But before we begin, here is the batch file template that you can use to run your Python script:

@echo off
"Path where your Python exe is stored\python.exe" "Path where your Python script is stored\script name.py"
pause
Steps to Create a Batch File to Run a Python Script
Step 1: Create the Python Script
To start, create your Python Script.

For example, let’s create a simple Python script that contains a countdown (alternatively, you may use any Python script that you wish to run):

countdown = 10

while countdown > 0:
    print ('CountDown = ', countdown)
    countdown = countdown - 1
Step 2: Save your Script
Save your Python script (your Python script should have the extension of ‘.py‘).

For our example, let’s save the Python script as: countdown

Where the file extension is .py
Step 3: Create the Batch File to Run the Python Script
To create the batch file, open Notepad and then use the following template:

@echo off
"Path where your Python exe is stored\python.exe" "Path where your Python script is stored\script name.py"
pause
You’ll need to adjust the syntax in two places:

“Path where your Python exe is stored\python.exe”
Here is an example where a Python exe is located: “C:\Users\Ron\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python39\python.exe”
“Path where your Python script is stored\script name.py”
And here is an example where a Python script is located:
“C:\Users\Ron\Desktop\Test\countdown.py”
Note that you’ll need to change the paths to reflect the locations where the files are stored on your computer.

This is how the batch script would look like in Notepad for our example:

@echo off
"C:\Users\Ron\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python39\python.exe" "C:\Users\Ron\Desktop\Test\countdown.py"
pause
Save the Notepad with a ‘.bat‘ extension. For example, let’s save the Notepad as Run_Script.bat

A new batch file, called “Run_Script.bat,” will be created at your specified location.

Step 4: Run the Batch File
Finally, double-click on the batch file in order to run the Python script.

You’ll then get the countdown as follows:

CountDown = 10
CountDown =  9
CountDown =  8
CountDown =  7
CountDown =  6
CountDown =  5
CountDown =  4
CountDown =  3
CountDown =  2
CountDown =  1
